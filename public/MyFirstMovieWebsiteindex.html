    <p>I really liked this movie because of the amazing portrayal of a super hero and the amazing comedy.<br />
    The action was awesome, the costume looked awesome and the last scene of him swinging from all the buidlings<br />
    in the outro was just superb. 10 out of 10.

    <p>This movie was so dramtic and pulled so many heart strings and had so many iconic lines<br />
    that it just brings you to tears to joy back to teats all the way back up to joy all again<br />
    a  ll in 2 hours. An amazing journey and triumph. Awesome  movie.</p>
